The core difference is:

DLib is a C++ library/toolkit that contains machine learning algorithms, including computer vision.
OpenCV is a C/C++ library of functions dealing with real-time computer vision.
Both the libraries are powerful and really efficient. They are available cross platform as well.

OpenCV has wrappers in various languages such as C++, Python and Java. 
DLib has a Python API.
